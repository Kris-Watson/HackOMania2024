Smart Power Consumption Monitor for Residential Flats
Introduction

The Smart Power Consumption Monitor (SPCM) is an IoT project aimed at providing real-time insights into the power usage of residential flats. By leveraging advanced IoT sensors and a robust backend infrastructure, SPCM enables residents to monitor their power consumption patterns, identify potential savings, and contribute to a more sustainable environment.
Features

    Real-time Power Consumption Tracking: Get instant readings of your power usage.
    Historical Data Analysis: Review past consumption patterns for better insight and decision-making.
    Alerts and Notifications: Set custom alerts for unusual power usage.
    Easy Integration: Compatible with various smart home ecosystems.
